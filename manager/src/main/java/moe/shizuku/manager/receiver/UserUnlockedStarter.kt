/**
 * Begins the boot start the moment the user unlocks, instead of when the system gets round to
 * BOOT_COMPLETED.
 *
 * The app is direct-boot aware, so the system can wake the process well before the first unlock
 * (a client asking for the binder, the locked-boot broadcast). Everything that starts a server goes
 * through WorkManager, whose database cannot be read until then, so a request made earlier is
 * deferred rather than lost, and this is what makes the request again. BOOT_COMPLETED follows some
 * seconds later and finds the start already in flight, which is what [decideStart] is for.
 *
 * ACTION_USER_UNLOCKED cannot be declared in the manifest, which is why this is a receiver
 * registered by the running process. A process that comes up after the unlock has nothing to
 * wait for and registers nothing; the watchdog and the boot receiver cover it as they always did.
